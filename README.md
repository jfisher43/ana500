# Data Preparation for ANA500 Micro-Projects

**Author**: James Fisher  
**Date**: 6-2-2024

## Overview

This repository contains the data preparation code for the ANA500 course and includes Micro Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4. The primary focus is on analyzing data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) with a specific interest in the target variable CIMEMLOS, worsening memory problems or confusion. Four machine learning models are explored to predict this output variable: multiple logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and neural network with TensorFlow.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the 2022 BRFSS, details of which which can be accessed at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2022/zip/codebook22_llcp-v2-508.zip

## Objective

The main objective is to explore 4 machine learning models in an effort to predict worsening memory loss and confusion. The variable selection process included early childhood trauma variables and was also guided by:
